    <h2>Chance Bloom</h2>
	<p>Hi y'all, The names Chance! In my free time you'll either catch me playing board games, working out, and learning new recipes in the kitchen.
    	I am from Phoenix, Arizona and I love it here! Obligatory "It's just a dry heat", but in all honesty after one 117 degree(F) summer you get used to it.
        I've been a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints my whole life (31 years!). Man I feel old writing that!</p>
	<p>Currently I'm pursuing a Bachelors Degree in Software Engineering while working part time. I enjoy working with code because I love seeing
    	all of the wonderful applications that people have made! One day I want to work on something big so that I can tell people, "You know that
    	app you use all the time? Well I helped create it!" </p>
	<p>I'm a pretty relaxed guy and I look forward to getting to know all of you as the semester goes on. Thanks for checking out my web page!</p>
